## Database

The application uses MySQL to store data about users, cars, and reservations.

## Requirements:

- .NET 8

- MySQL Server

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/your-username/carrental.git
cd carrental
```

## Step 2: Configure Database Connection

The MySQL connection string is stored in the applicationâ€™s secret settings. To configure it, set it using User Secrets:
```cmd
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "server=localhost;database=CarRentalDB;user=root;password=yourpassword;"
```

Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable.

## Step 3: Apply Database Migrations
```cmd
dotnet ef database update
```
## Step 4: Run the Application
```cmd
dotnet run
```
The application should be accessible at http://localhost:7090/.
